## Key Information about the Project

1. **Project Architecture**:
   - The project is structured into three key modules:
     - `client`: Handles client-side operations, virtual channel preparation (TCP), and UDP communication loops.
     - `server`: Implements server-side logic including Peer management and handling connections.
     - `common`: Provides shared utilities like logging, protocol definitions, and virtual channel abstractions.

2. **Build System**:
   - It uses CMake for managing dependencies and building the project modules (`client`, `server`, `common`).
   - Libraries and modules are organized with `COMMON`, supporting modular development.

3. **Communication Protocol**:
   - Data communication leverages TCP for virtual channels and UDP for secondary functions.

4. **Initialization and Configurations**:
   - Clients initialize using centralized configurations from `ClientConfiguration`; similar setups are mirrored in `ServerConfiguration`.
   - Socket creation and handling follow standard practices with win32 and POSIX flexibility.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - A dynamic log management level (DEBUG, INFO) assists troubleshooting.

6. **Test Binder Overview**:
   - Unit tests reside under `/src/tests`. Sample mocks include `Protocol_test scenarios.`
