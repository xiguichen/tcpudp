# Memory Management Improvements

This document describes the memory management improvements implemented in the TCP/UDP server and client applications.

## Overview

The codebase has been enhanced with advanced memory management techniques to optimize performance, reduce memory usage, and prevent memory leaks. These improvements include:

1. **Memory Pool**: A thread-safe memory pool for efficient buffer allocation and reuse
2. **Buffer Recycling**: Reuse of buffers to minimize memory allocations
3. **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of memory usage with alerts
4. **Smart Buffer Sizing**: Adaptive buffer sizing based on actual data needs
5. **Lock-Free Queues**: Optimized queue implementations for better performance

## Implementation Details

### 1. Memory Pool

A comprehensive memory pool has been implemented in `MemoryPool.h` that provides:

- Thread-safe buffer allocation and recycling
- Size-based buffer categorization (small, medium, large)
- Automatic memory trimming to prevent memory bloat
- Performance statistics tracking

```cpp
// Get a buffer from the pool
auto buffer = MemoryPool::getInstance().getBuffer(size);

// Use the buffer
buffer->resize(actualSize);
buffer->assign(data, data + length);

// Return the buffer to the pool when done
MemoryPool::getInstance().recycleBuffer(buffer);
```

### 2. Memory Monitoring

A memory monitoring system has been implemented in `MemoryMonitor.h` that provides:

- Real-time tracking of memory allocations and deallocations
- Memory usage alerts when thresholds are exceeded
- Periodic logging of memory usage statistics
- Human-readable memory size formatting

```cpp
// Start memory monitoring
MemoryMonitor::getInstance().start();

// Track memory allocation
MemoryMonitor::getInstance().trackAllocation(bytes);

// Track memory deallocation
MemoryMonitor::getInstance().trackDeallocation(bytes);

// Log memory usage
MemoryMonitor::getInstance().logMemoryUsage();
```

### 3. Smart Buffer Management

The application now uses smart buffer management techniques:

- Buffers are sized based on actual data needs
- Buffers are reused when possible to minimize allocations
- Buffers are recycled when no longer needed
- Memory is periodically trimmed to prevent bloat

```cpp
// Resize buffer only when needed
if (buffer->capacity() < requiredSize) {
    // Get a larger buffer from the pool
    auto newBuffer = MemoryPool::getInstance().getBuffer(requiredSize * 1.2);
    
    // Copy existing data if needed
    if (!buffer->empty()) {
        newBuffer->insert(newBuffer->end(), buffer->begin(), buffer->end());
    }
    
    // Recycle the old buffer
    MemoryPool::getInstance().recycleBuffer(buffer);
    
    // Use the new buffer
    buffer = newBuffer;
}
```

### 4. Lock-Free Queue Improvements

The client-side queues have been updated to use lock-free implementations:

- `UdpToTcpQueue` now uses a lock-free queue for better performance
- `TcpToUdpQueue` now uses a lock-free queue for better performance
- Both queues now use memory pooling for buffer management

```cpp
// Lock-free queue implementation
LockFreeQueue<std::shared_ptr<std::vector<char>>> queue;

// Enqueue with non-blocking retry
while (!queue.enqueue(buffer)) {
    // If queue is full, yield to allow consumers to process
    std::this_thread::yield();
}

// Dequeue with timeout
std::shared_ptr<std::vector<char>> result;
if (queue.dequeue_with_timeout(result, 100)) {
    // Process the result
}
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Buffer Pooling**: By reusing buffers, we significantly reduce the number of memory allocations and deallocations, which improves performance and reduces memory fragmentation.

2. **Smart Sizing**: Buffers are sized based on actual data needs, which reduces memory waste and improves cache efficiency.

3. **Lock-Free Queues**: By using lock-free queues, we eliminate contention and improve throughput in multi-threaded scenarios.

4. **Memory Monitoring**: By tracking memory usage, we can identify and address memory leaks and excessive memory usage.

5. **Periodic Trimming**: By periodically trimming the memory pool, we prevent memory bloat while still maintaining good performance.

## Memory Usage Statistics

The memory management system provides detailed statistics about memory usage:

```cpp
// Get memory pool statistics
MemoryPool::MemoryStats stats = MemoryPool::getInstance().getStats();
```

This returns information about:

- Total allocated memory
- Total buffers created
- Buffers recycled
- Small/medium/large buffers available

Similarly, queue statistics can be obtained:

```cpp
// Get queue statistics
UdpToTcpQueue::QueueStats stats = udpToTcpQueue.getStats();
```

This returns information about:

- Current queue size
- Peak queue size
- Total enqueued/dequeued items
- Average packet size
- Average wait time

## Conclusion

The memory management improvements significantly enhance the performance and reliability of the TCP/UDP server and client applications. By efficiently managing memory resources, the application can handle more connections with less memory and provide better responsiveness under high load.
