# Performance Improvements

This document outlines the performance improvements made to the TCP/UDP server.

## 1. Lock-Free Queues

Replaced mutex-based queues with a custom lock-free implementation to reduce contention and improve throughput.

### Files Changed:
- Added `src/common/LockFreeQueue.h` - A new lock-free queue implementation
- Modified `src/server/TcpDataQueue.h` and `src/server/TcpDataQueue.cpp`
- Modified `src/server/UdpDataQueue.h` and `src/server/UdpDataQueue.cpp`

### Benefits:
- Eliminates lock contention in high-throughput scenarios
- Reduces context switching overhead
- Improves scalability with multiple threads

## 2. Unordered Maps

Replaced `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` for socket mappings to improve lookup performance.

### Files Changed:
- Modified `src/server/TcpToUdpSocketMap.h` and `src/server/TcpToUdpSocketMap.cpp`
- Modified `src/server/UdpToTcpSocketMap.h` and `src/server/UdpToTcpSocketMap.cpp`
- Modified `src/server/UdpSocketAddressMap.h` and `src/server/UdpSocketAddressMap.cpp`

### Benefits:
- Reduces lookup complexity from O(log n) to O(1) average case
- Pre-allocated capacity to avoid rehashing
- Improved error handling for non-existent keys

## 3. Performance Monitoring

Added a performance monitoring system to track throughput, latency, and packet processing metrics.

### Files Changed:
- Added `src/common/PerformanceMonitor.h` - A new performance monitoring singleton
- Modified `src/server/main.cpp` to start monitoring
- Integrated monitoring into queue implementations

### Benefits:
- Real-time visibility into system performance
- Ability to identify bottlenecks
- Metrics for throughput (packets/sec and Mbps)
- Latency tracking for packet processing

## 4. Memory Management

Improved memory management in the queue implementations.

### Benefits:
- Reduced memory allocations
- Better handling of buffer sizes
- More efficient data copying

## 5. Atomic Operations

Replaced mutex-protected variables with atomic operations where appropriate.

### Benefits:
- Reduced synchronization overhead
- Better scalability
- Lower latency for simple operations

## Expected Performance Improvements

These changes should result in:

1. **Higher Throughput**: The lock-free queues and unordered maps should allow the system to process more packets per second.

2. **Lower Latency**: Reduced contention and synchronization overhead should decrease the time it takes to process each packet.

3. **Better Scalability**: The system should now scale better with additional CPU cores and higher connection counts.

4. **Improved Stability**: Better error handling and more robust implementations should reduce the likelihood of crashes under high load.

## Monitoring and Tuning

The performance monitoring system will output metrics every 30 seconds, including:
- Packets processed per second
- Throughput in Mbps
- Average processing latency

Use these metrics to further tune the system parameters, such as:
- Queue sizes
- Thread counts
- Buffer sizes

## Future Improvements

Additional performance improvements that could be considered:
1. Implement a memory pool for packet buffers
2. Add CPU affinity for critical threads
3. Implement vectored I/O operations
4. Replace thread-per-connection model with an event-driven approach
